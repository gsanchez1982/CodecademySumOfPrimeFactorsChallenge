This is a Codecademy Code Challenge.

The challenge is to create a python script that includes a function called sum_of_prime_factors(), which takes in an integer n and returns the sum of all of its prime factors.

As a reminder, a prime number is a number whose only factors are one and itself. Therefore, a prime factor is a factor of a given number that itself is a prime number.

For example, sum_of_prime_factors(91) should return 20 since its prime factors are 13 and 7.
